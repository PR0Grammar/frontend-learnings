## Intro

- Webpack is a static module bundler for JS apps. When webpack processes your JS app, it interally builds a dependency graph from one or more "entry points" and combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles. These are your static assets to serve your client.

- webpack works similar to typescript - there is a raw "src" directory with all the JS and a "dist" folder where the bundled moudle(s) live.
